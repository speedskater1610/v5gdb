# v5gdb: VEX V5 debugger

> *"One day we will have all the features of ROBOTC on the V5 brain" - Charles, 2114V*

v5gdb is a debugger backend for the VEX V5 platform that is compatible with GDB. It uses a combination of hardware and software breakpoints to implement features like line-by-line stepping and user-defined breakpoints. Users are also given the ability to read program state such as the arguments passed to the active function or global variables.

## Getting Started

Please read the [user manual]!

[user manual]: https://github.com/vexide/v5gdb/wiki

## Features

Here are the features of v5gdb that you can use today:

- Debug server usable by an instance of `gdb`
- Supports multiple methods of communication with a debugger client running on the user's PC
- Transparent breakpoint handling compatible with all existing VEX runtimes
- Supports remote management of dynamically-placed software/hardware breakpoints
- Single-step through instructions and lines of code
- Easy to configure and enable via Rust and C++ APIs

## Future Goals

Here are the features of v5gdb that aren't done yet or are planned for the future:

- Easy to add to existing projects via a Rust crate and PROS template (for now, see the install instructions in the [user manual])
- Step through inactive PROS tasks (right now, you can only step through the task that caused the most recent breakpoint)

## Design

This project implements a debug server that can communicate with a GDB-compatible client over various transport methods. For more information, see the project's [internals wiki page](https://internals.vexide.dev/technical/debugger).
